1.   Start the Game:   Press any key to begin.
2.   Watch the Blink:   A button will blink in a random color (e.g., red).
3.   Click the Button:   Click on the blinking button and then select another button of your choice (e.g., green).
4.   Next Blink:   Another random button will blink (e.g., yellow).
5.   Click the Button:   Click on the new blinking button, followed by the button you selected earlier (green), then select a new button (e.g., purple).
